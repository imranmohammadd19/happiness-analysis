## 📌 Key Factors Affecting Happiness (Correlation Insights):

| Factor                        | Correlation with Happiness |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Economy (GDP per Capita)     | Strong positive             |
| Health (Life Expectancy)     | Strong positive             |
| Freedom                      | Moderate positive           |
| Trust in Government          | Weak to moderate positive   |
| Generosity                   | Weak positive               |

- **GDP and Health** are the most influential contributors to happiness.

## 🌍 Regional Comparison

- **Western Europe** has the highest average happiness score.
- **Sub-Saharan Africa** ranks the lowest.
- This suggests significant regional inequality in well-being.

---

## 📈 Visual Summary Highlights

## 📚 Learnings + What’s Next

- Happiness is clearly influenced by multiple dimensions, not just money.
- For deeper insights, we could:
  - Analyze **year-over-year trends** if data was multi-year.
  - Collect more recent data (e.g., post-pandemic changes).
  - Explore **machine learning models** to predict happiness based on features.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- JupyterLab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly for interactivity

## ✅ Conclusion:
This analysis helped reinforce your understanding of EDA, visualization, and the importance of thinking **logically about the relationships** in data — not just plotting them blindly.
